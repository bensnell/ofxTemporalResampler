// This class is useful for downsampling something which runs too
// fast, or upsampling something which runs too slow. It is 
// intended to make use of a thread's sleep function to adjust 
// the time of a cycle. It is loosely based on the functioning
// of Kalman filters. It has been designed to sleep for a discrete
// number of milliseconds, instead of a continuous number.
